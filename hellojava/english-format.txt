I agree completely
I am hesitating

I am in the airport lounge
I am on a pension
I am quite thirsty
I am right-handed
I apologize for the delay
I appreciate your kindness
I ate breakfast
I bumped into the door
I came here on foot
I came up with an idea
I can't be absent
a
I can't bear him
I can't fall asleep
I can't let this chant slip
I can't let this chance slip
I can't live without it
I can't stay for long
I cannot take it with me
I changed the trash bag
I chase my own shadow
the nightly Bang
I chatted with some friends
I clean household objects
Toby Tyler
I closed my ears
I completed the mission
I confessed to the priest
I couldn't hide my sorrow
I cry like a kid
I dare not say a word
and a
I declined his invitation
I deliberately ignored him
I designed my own house
I did try to warn you
I didn't dare refuse
I discovered his affair
I divided it in half
I don't carry much cash
I don't know where to start
I don't mean to annoy you
'll come eBay
I don't think so
I don't want a sunburn
I doubt it
I dropped my keys
I earn enough to live
I enjoy reading
I entered the gate
I exercise every morning
I exercise in the gym
hi
I failed miserably
I feed my children
I feel dizzy
I feel fine
I feel guilty
I feel lonely and homesick
I feel sympathy for her
I felt young again
Falco
I filled the cup with water
I finished reading the book
I forgot to ask him his name
i gaze at the stars
I got dressed quickly
I got lost
there
I got stuck in traffic
I had no means of transport
I hate litter
I hate rush hour traffic
I have a bad cold
I have a boyfriend
I have a family to feed
like
I have a loose tooth
home
I have a lot to do today
I have a pet cat

I have a surprise for you
I have an older brother
I have guests this weekend

I have now time to spare
I Have Nothing Left to Lose
I have the flu
will be so down
I have tooth decay

I haven't eaten lunch yet
I heard explosions
I hid under a bed
I hope I get there in time
I hope I pass the test
I hope you don't mind
I hurried after her
too
I know every school student
I know the feeling
I lack business knowledge
I lack practical experience
I learned it easily
I lifted the Box
again
I like even numbers
I like its shape
I like the rain sounds
I like this fashion style
I like this fragrance
I liked them both
I limit my sugar intake
I live away from home
I live in a small town
day
I live near here
I live on the floor below
I love happy endings
I made it clear to you
Lambda
I made it myself
I made the right decision
I mainly self-study at home
I missed the last bus
I nearly forgot
I need it urgently
I need more time to recover
y
I need time to consider
I need to change clothes
I need to charge my phone
I need to go to the bank
I need to heat the soup
and
I need to improve my English
I need to speak with you
I need to take a day off
I never hit my children
I nod my head in agreement
I often snore
I often watch Comedy
I only follow the rules
I only have one son
toy
I only know how to boil eggs
I overcame my fear
ful
I plan to stay in this city
I plan to stay in the city
I plant a vegetable garden
I prefer foreign films
I prefer sitting in front
I prepared thoroughly
I pressed my ear to the door
I pretend to be asleep
I pretend to ignore him
I probably shouldn't buy
I pulled the curtain aside
I pursue an acting career
I put a cap on my head
I quit my job there
I ran across the street
I ran home quickly
I rang the bell and waited
I rarely wear a hat
outside
I read a book to kill time
I recall meeting her before
I recorded the conversation
I remember every detail
I respect your privacy
I ruined everything
I saw a man passing by
I scraped my knee
I sent him a message
I sent it by post
I set my alarm clock
I set my alarm for 7am
I saw this button back on
I sewed this button back on
I share your sorrow
I shook my head sadly
High
I showed no fear
I showed Mel fear

I sighed in relief

I sneeze all the time
I squeezed half a lemon
Ade
I stayed up all night
baby
I swear to you
I tidy up the house
I took the dog for a walk
I took the kids to the park
I took two steps forward
I tossed the coin
I travel abroad a lot
I tried hard not to laugh
I tripped over a cable
I trust you
I twisted my ankle
I understand how you feel
I walked along the road
I walked toward her
I want to lose some weight
I want to scream out loud
I was the first to arrive
d
I will come in time
I will count from 1 to 10.
I will count from one to ten
I will finish it tonight
I will take her home soon
I will take you shopping
I wish I could fly
I won't mention it again
I wonder who this is
I work in shifts
I work like a dog all day
I write with my left hand
I'd like a coffee to go
I'd like to return this
license
I'll be back soon
I'll be right back
I'll be right there on time
I'll check again
I'll do my best
I'll get one for you
I'll put it in a safe place
I'll try to fit you in
I'll wait until they arrive
I'm afraid of heights
I'm always on call
language
I'm an early riser
I'm cooking in the kitchen
I'm deeply grateful

I'm not hungry now
I'm not in the office today
I'm not interested
I'm not picky about food
I'm not surprised at all

I'm responsible for my work
I'm right behind you
I'm scared to death
I'm serious
I'm so proud of you
I'm starving
I'm still hungry
I'm still sleepy
I'm taking a shortcut
I'm trying to date her
I'm very happy for you
I'm watching a film
I'm wide awake
I've gained weight recently
Dao
I've got a sore throat
I've got acne again
I've never been there
I've not decided yet
I've only been there once
I've only met him twice
I've run out of patience
I've spent all my money

it all happened so suddenly
it costs a lot of money
it depends on the weather
it disappeared Into Thin Air
though
it doesn't matter
it drives me crazy
it gave me goosebumps
it is a zone of danger
ous
it is as frail as a thread
it is raining heavily
it looks delicious
it rained all week
it seems like yesterday
it started to rain
it was all my fault
it was an exciting trip
it was my own idea
it was nice to meet you
it was pleasant to be alone
it was the shock of my life
it wasn't too long ago
it's a basic skill
download
it's a fact of life
it's a fantastic idea
it's a full moon tonight
it's a local custom
it's a long story
it's a memorable lesson
it's a pity you didn't come
It's a Small World
it's about a meter high
it's all true
it's almost finished
it's an everyday thing
look
it's beyond compare
it's beyond my abilities
it's close to midnight
it's cool outside
it's dirt cheap
it's freezing cold
Joy
it's getting dark
apply bank
it's great to see you again
it's hard to believe
it's midnight
it's my daily routine
it's my favorite flavor
it's my treat today
it's nice weather today
it's nobody's fault
you go
it's not dry yet
it's not my duty

it's so unfair
it's the law of nature
it's the original document

it's very emotional
it's driving me crazy

marriages come by Destiny

may I have your name
maybe you should tell her
mind your head
mind your own affairs
mom is at it again
music helps me relax

my calendar is fall
my calendar is full
my group has disbanded
my hair is naturally curly
new Bang
my hands are cold as ice
my hands are dirty
my hands are too rough

my heart beats very fast
my heart is pounding
my heel is cracked
my hobby is cooking
my mother is strict
my results were unexpected
why
my son is playing outside
my wallet was stolen
my whole body aches
no pain no gain
all day
no parking here
nobody answered the phone
nobody cares
nobody is perfect
oi
nothing has changed
now is the digital age
nowhere is like home
now my
pain is never permanent
please be quiet
please leave me alone
please open the trunk
please save me a seat
please show me another one
please sit still
please try again later
please wait a few moments

somebody broke that
I died
someone pushed me down
sorry to interrupt

spring is coming soon
stand up straight
stick with me
stop before it's too late
stop biting your nails
stop making noise
stop picking your nose
take a big bite
take a deep breath
take a look at yourself
take me a dessert
take me to this address
take my advice
tell me where it hurts
thanks for a delicious meal
that dress is stunning
that makes me mad
Onna
that was just a joke
that wasn't an ordeal
that wasn't my intention
Ally
that's really interesting
that's what people say
the air is fresh here
enjoy
the bus is here
the challenge is ahead
the dog barked all night
long
the meal was delicious
the park is very crowded
the parking lot is full now
the police arrested him
the road ahead was blocked
the road is under repair
the same to you
the short answer is no
David
the sky was still dark
the weather was awful
there's no time to waste
there's too much choice
they deserve to win
they love each other
daifa
they often quarrel
they revoked my license
they serve very quickly
things will get better
think about it no more
think carefully
this is a basic human need

wait for a moment
waiting is torture

wash your hands with soap
we came on foot
age
we chatted for a while
we danced to the music
we drank a can of each
we got caught in the rain
we grew up together
we need to talk
we ran out of toilet paper
we succeeded
we toasted the couple
we toast to the couple
we wear uniforms
we were both tired
we will live together
we're all in the same boat
we've got to go
